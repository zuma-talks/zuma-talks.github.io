        </li>
        <li id="abstract_221" class="abstract">The Rankin–Selberg method is a classical approach for constructing integral representations of L-functions, facilitating their meromorphic continuation and the establishment of functional equations. In this talk, we present a novel perspective that interprets Rankin–Selberg integrals within the framework of double flag varieties of finite type. We introduce the concept of strongly tempered spherical varieties of Rankin–Selberg type and, leveraging the classification by He, Nishiyama, Ochiai, and Oshima, systematically identify all Rankin–Selberg integrals associated with these varieties. This framework enables a unified treatment of local zeta integrals and the gamma factors for this family. As an application, we can derive complete L-functions corresponding to these Rankin–Selberg integrals and establish local multiplicity formulas via the local relative trace formula for certain strongly tempered spherical varieties of Gan–Gross–Prasad type over p-adic fields.</li>

This bound only depends on the rank and the Abbes-Saito's logarithmic ramification conductor along the boundary. We will focus on the ideas of the proof.

        </li>
        <li id="abstract_305" class="abstract">In this talk, we introduce an approach to obtaining non-vanishing results for the central values of automorphic L-functions. Specifically, we consider Rankin–Selberg L-functions associated with cuspidal automorphic representations of general linear groups, which parametrize automorphic representations of classical groups. Our method relies on the close connection between automorphic descent constructions and the Gan–Gross–Prasad conjectures. For general-rank cases, we will explain how this approach yields non-vanishing central L-values under certain assumptions. In particular, for some lower-rank cases, we can establish unconditional non-vanishing results for the central L-values of cuspidal automorphic representations twisted by certain characters.</li>

        </li>
        <li id="abstract_312" class="abstract">A general problem in the theory of Shimura varieties is to understand the geometry mod p of suitable integral models. The purpose of my talk is to discuss the case of unitary Shimura varieties at places of the CM field that are ramified over Q. My first aim is to explain how the Eisenstein condition can be used to deal with this type of ramification. My second aim is to define an isomorphism between different kinds of local Shimura varieties in this setting. My third aim is to describe some applications to arithmetic intersection problems. This is joint work with Yu Luo and Zhiyu Zhang.</li>

        </li>
        <li id="abstract_319" class="abstract">In p-adic geometry, there are more mysterious rational p-adic local systems than in algebraic/complex geometry, for example, the analytification of P^1 is no longer simply connected due to existence of a rank 2 rational p-adic local system. The cohomology of such local systems were studied previously by Kedlaya–Liu and more recently by Anschütz–Le Bras–Mann. In this talk, we shall see a (relatively) low-tech approach to reprove some of KL/ALBM results. This is a report of an ongoing work joint with Niziol–Reinecke–Zavyalov.</li>

        </li>
        <li id="abstract_326s" class="abstract">The local intertwining relations for classical groups are the second main local theorem in Arthur’s theory of endoscopic classification. They are identities that give precise information about the action of normalized intertwining operators on parabolically induced representations. In this talk, I will explain the local intertwining relation for twisted general linear groups, which is also required in the inductive proof of the endoscopic classification for quasi-split classical groups due to Arthur and Mok. This talk is based on a joint work with Atsushi Ichino (Kyoto), Wee Teck Gan (Singapore), Alberto Minguez (Vienna), Tasho Kaletha (Bonn), and Sug Woo Shin (UC Berkeley).</li>

Here we focus on a related but different aspect of the local intertwining relation (LIR) in the context of Arthur’s inductive proof of endoscopic classification. The main theme is how to deduce the LIR and local A-packet classification for certain non-tempered representations from the tempered case via Aubert duality.</li>

        </li>
        <li id="abstract_409" class="abstract">The geometric Bogomolov conjecture, originally formulated for abelian varieties over function fields, suggests that in a non-special closed subvariety, the points with canonical height bounded from above by a postive number (depending on the subvariety) are not Zariski dense. This was a long-standing conjecture until the proof of Xie–Yuan. We generalize and prove the conjecture for semi-abelian varieties. A new phenomenon is that a special subvariety may not have Zariski-densely many points of canonical height 0. This is a joint work with Jiawei Yu.</li>

        </li>
        <li id="abstract_416" class="abstract">The definition/study of L invariants via locally analytic representation theory has been initiated by Breuil in the case of GL(2,Q_p). The GL(3,Q_p) case has been studied extensively by Schraen and Breuil–Ding from different aspects. Motivated by their work and Gehrmann's work on automorphic L invariants, it is clear that understanding higher Ext groups between various locally analytic generalized Steinberg is crucial to develop the theory of (higher) L invariants for GL(n). A key example of such Ext groups is Ext_G^{n-1}(1,St_G^{an}) (*) with G=PGL(n,K) and St_G^{an} being the locally analytic Steinberg representation of G. We would first present a list of results on the structure of (*) which technically depends on the interpretation of top primitive class of sl_n using relative Lie algebra cohomology w.r.t. sl_{n-1}. Then we discuss how the theory of higher L invariants for GL(n) is essentially equivalent to an isomorphism between (*) and certain Galois Ext^1 group. Finally we consider some canonical subspaces of both (*) and its Galois counterpart, and discuss how such isomorphism might be explicitly characterized.</li>

(FYI) Colloquium abstract: Shimura varieties are algebraic varieties over a number field. A characteristic feature of them is the abundance of self-correspondences, given by the so-called Hecke correspondences. In the theory of Shimura varieties the construction of integral models has seen a lot of activities over the years. However, the construction of integral models of Hecke correspondences is still in its infancy. I will explain the problem and some recent progress (joint work with Ulrich Gortz and Xuhua He).</li>
